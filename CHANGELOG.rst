2.0
--------
Started doing a changelog!

2.1
--------
If you have the "lorem ipsum" module then your text will be edited with
a randomly generated piece of text. This prevents Reddit from (for example)
not actually deleting things if they edit the comment to a static value
before deleting.

3.0
--------
PEP8 compliance and complete rewrite to use Python 3. Don't upgrade to this
version unless you have a working Python 3 (tested with Python 3.4).
Also added a requirements.txt which allows one to `pip install -r requirements.txt`
